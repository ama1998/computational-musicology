What is your corpus, why did you choose it, and what do you think is interesting about it?
How do hip-hop and r&b tracks from the late 1990s and early 2000' correspond in hip-hop and r&b tracks nowadays (sampled music)? Is sampling nowadays more common? did it increase over the years?..etc. I still have to the specify the time frame for what i mean with "nowadays"

What are the natural groups or comparison points in your corpus (e.g., albums, artists, genres, people)? What do you expect to be different among these groups, what do you expect to be the same, and what are you unsure about?
I want to use both genres and compare them within a few time frames to see the gradual change over time, the correspondence with each other, to see if music is sampled, etc.
"In music, sampling is the reuse of a portion of a sound recording in another recording. Samples may comprise elements such as rhythm, melody, speech, sounds or entire bars of music, and may be layered, equalized, sped up or slowed down, repitched, looped, or otherwise manipulated." I want to setup certain groups to evaluate this, but i do not know how i am going to do this yet. (dicuss during the practical).

How representative are the tracks in your corpus for the groups you want to compare? For example, is there a well-known difference between the live and studio versions of one of the artists, or is Spotify missing an important recording? Or if you are using a personal playlist of yourself or someone else, what percentage of your or their music listening takes place on Spotify? If your corpus is genre-based, how well do you think it covers the genre you are interested in, and what do you think are the most important gaps? There is no such thing as a perfect corpus, and it is important to think from the beginning about its strengths and limitations.
i am using playlists from time periods and want to compare those using the differenct comparison points listed above. The playlists are pretty reliable, if i look up a "r&b and hip-hop 90's 00's" all tracks are actually in this time frame and the tracks are all within these genres. I am still looking for the exact playlists i am gong to use since i want playlists of approximately the same size

Identify several tracks in your corpus that are either extremely typical or atypical. Why do you think that they are so typical or so strange? Several pages of your final portfolio will be dedicated to detailed analyses of specific tracks, and so it is important to think about which ones might be most interesting.
Well all of my songs are pretty typical since i work with a genre, i did not cross any anamolies yet.

Sorry for my brief description i follow 4 courses (intensive ones) so i am trying to manage all of them, i hope i can extend this a bit tommorow in the practical, since i am not that sure yet about my comparison groups!
